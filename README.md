# Claude with the Anthropic API Course Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that accompany the [Claude with the Anthropic API course](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/claude-with-the-anthropic-api) from Anthropic Academy.

## üìö Course Overview

This comprehensive course teaches developers how to integrate Claude AI into applications using the Anthropic API. The curriculum covers:

- **Fundamental API operations** - Authentication, request configuration, and basic interactions
- **Advanced prompting techniques** - System prompts, temperature control, structured outputs
- **Tool integration** - Custom tools, batch operations, web search capabilities
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Text chunking, embeddings, search, and contextual retrieval
- **Extended features** - Image analysis, PDF processing, citations, and prompt caching
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - Standardized tool and resource integration
- **Anthropic Apps** - Claude Code and Computer Use for automation
- **Agent-based systems** - Parallelization, chaining, and routing workflows

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- Set up and authenticate with the Anthropic API
- Implement single and multi-turn conversations
- Configure system prompts and control model behavior
- Design prompt evaluation workflows
- Apply advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Integrate Claude's tool use capabilities
- Build RAG systems with text chunking and embeddings
- Utilize Claude's multimodal capabilities
- Implement prompt caching strategies
- Develop MCP servers and clients
- Deploy Anthropic Apps
- Architect agent-based systems

## üìã Prerequisites

- Proficiency in Python programming
- Basic knowledge of handling JSON data
